# Pairs

Once we have one pair, we can arbitrarily nest them to create whatever we want.

What do we need to implement pairs?

* construct pairs
* destruct pairs
* syntax
* representation (passing, returning?, tagging)
    * printing
* anf?
    * CExpr, but not IExpr
* types
* well formed
* mutability?
* evaluation order

##Accessing

* first, second -> doesn't generalize well to arbitrary length tuples
* accessing syntax (a[i]) -> doesn't typecheck easily
* destructuring let statements -> let's do that

## representation

* tag value
* addresses will always map to a word so we don't need all the bits
