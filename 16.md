# Lambdas

```python
def applyToFive(it):
    it(5)

def incr(x):
    x+1

# gets converted to

let applyToFive = (lambda it: it(5)) in
let incr = (lambda x: x+1) in
    applyToFive(incr)
```

But now there are more problems:

* Maybe my whole program returns a lambda
* Maybe a function returns a lambda

```python
let plus = (位(x): let ans = (位(y): x+y) in ans) in # x is free in ans
let add1 = plus(1) in
let add2 = plus(2) in
    add1(5)
```

How can we guarantee we are currying the values properly? How can we guarantee `add2` will be calling plus with 2?

We need to add any free variables into our closure. To find this, we take all variables in the body of the function and subtract the arguments and lhs of `let`

We need to be able to compile lambdas and compile closures.

How do I compile this code:

```
let incr = 位(x): x + 1) in
    incr(5)
```

```asm
ocsh:
    # produce the value of incr
incr:
    ...
    ret
    ...
    # mov [wherever incr belongs], EAX
    mov [EBP - 4], EAX
```

But now there's a label in the middle how to we get from one side to the other in normal program execution?

We can lift it outside like we used to, called lambda lifting/hoisting, but that's complicated. It involves forcing all free variables into arguments so they're no longer free.

However, for now we can just jump over it.

```asm
ocsh:
    # produce the value of incr
    jmp incr_end
incr:
    ...
    ret
incr_end:
    # produce closure value
    mov [ESI], <arity>
    mov [ESI + 4], incr
    mov [ESI + 8], <# free variables>

    # copying free variables (alphabetized)
    mov EAX, [EBP - 4]      # copy y

    mov [ESI + 12], EAX
    mov EAX, ESI            # ESI = top of heap
    add EAX, 5              # tag

    # 3 comes from 1 bit for fun arity, code pointer, num free vars
    add ESI, <4 * (3 + num free vars) + (parity padding)>

    # mov [wherever incr belongs], ESI
    mov [EBP - 8], ESI
```

We need to know the number of free variables at runtime for garbage collection

When calling function, we can unroll our closure onto the stack so calling the function will be just like we have a bunch of let bound variables.

```
def foo(w,x,y,z):
    (位(a): a+x+z)

foo(1,2,3,4)(5)
```

```
foo:
----------------
self    [EBP+8]
w       [EBP+12]
x       [EBP+16]
y       [EBP+20]
z       [EBP+24]

lambda:
----------------
self    [EBP+8]
a       [EBP+12]
# this takes two memory hops :(
# also probably will be on two diff memory pages = no locality
x       -[self+12]->[EBP-4]
z       -[self+16]->[EBP-8]
```

```asm
ocsh:
    j foo_end
    foo:
        j lam_end
        lam:
            mov EAX, [EBP+8]    # get self param
            mov EBX, [EAX+12]   # swap
            mov [EBP-4], EBX    # load x
            mov EBX, [EAX+8]    # swap
            mov [EBP-8], EBX    # load z

            mov EAX, [EBP+12]
            add EAX, [EBP-4]    # load arg a
            ...........other stuff
        lam_end:
            mov [ESI+0], 1      # arity
            mov [ESI+4], lam    # code pointer
            mov [ESI+8], 2      # free vars
            mov EAX, [EBP+16]   # swap space
            mov [ESI+12], EAX   # move x
            mov EAX, [EBP+24]   # swap space
            mov [ESI+16], EAX   # mov z
            mov EAX, ESI        # answer = closure
            add EAX, 0x5        # tag
            add ESI, 24         # reserve space (with padding)
        ...
        ret
    foo_end:
        mov [ESI+0], 4      # arity
        mov [ESI+4], foo    # code pointer
        mov [ESI+8], 0      # free vars
        mov EAX, ESI        # answer = closure
        add EAX, 0x5        # tag
        add ESI, 16         # reserve space
```
