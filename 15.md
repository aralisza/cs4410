# First class functions

When compiling a label, nasm translates it into an address. When we're passing around first class functions, we can do the same thing.

```python
def applyToFive(it):
    it(5)

def incr(i):
    add1(i)
```

We know how to compile `incr`. Let's compile `applyToFive`.

```nasm
applyToFive:
    push EBP
    move EBP, ESP
    mov EAX,  [EBP + 8]
    push 10 # value 5
    call EAX # disturbing, but works because it jumps to the address in EAX
    add ESP, 4
    mov ESP, EBP
    pop EBP
    ret
```

But what if your arity is wrong? We need to have dynamic arity checks. To do this, we need to store the arity as well as the address of the function.

Let's push a tuple instead of just an address. Except it actually isn't a tuple. We will be using a separate tag that points to a structure that is the same as a tuple. So, if we try to operate on a function like a tuple, it will cause a tag error.

We also need to be able to bind the tuple with a name so we can refer to it. We can just use `let` to do this. However, `let` requires an expression to be on the RHS. This can be a lambda.

Now how do we make recursion work? We don't have the tuple until the function is done compiled. We have to pass the function into itself.

So far, our type system is good enough to do all this. However, what about currying? Now we need a real closure. This tuple thingy is our closure.

What does it mean to close over a mutable variable?
