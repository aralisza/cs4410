## Q&A

### Seq: desugar or not?

If you desugar into `let`s, it will create extra stack slots in order to store garbage. This can result in a higher minimum memory bound than expecting because if it's bound, it can't be garbage collected.

### Final project

Go to office hours some time this week to scope out project.

Possible projects:

* strings
* some kind of optimizations
    * get rid of "many" unnecessary moves
* objects
    * something like dictionaries
    * something like dynamic dispatch
    * constructors, state, inheritance, visibility, etc are all optional
    * implement objects as closures
* modules...?
    * circular dependencies?
    * multiple includes?
    * separate compilation?
    * imports shadowing?
    * ...many more
* specialization/monomorphization
    * could be huge
* foreign function interface
* retargeting compiler to web assembly
    * porting garbage collector to web assembly
* threading, coroutines, generators
* (non-trivial) macros
    * e.g., hygienic macros
* exceptions (e.g., option type)

## Optimization

We will need more info than just a tree to optimize...

### Constant folding

```
let n = 5 + 5 in
let m = 2 * 2 in
let x = n + 1 in
let y = m + 2 in
    x + y
```

It's very clear we can do all this arithmetic at compile time.

What if we change m...

```
let n = 5 + 5 in
let m = z * z in
let x = n + 1 in
let y = m + 2 in
    x + y
```

The answer is `11 + y`, which means we can still get rid of `x` and `n`.

How many registers would I need to evaluate this?

```
let n = 5 + 5 in
let m = 2 * 2 in
let x = n + 1 in
let y = m + 2 in
    x + y
```

How do we find this systematically?


```
let n = 5 + 5 in (* no variables defined *)
let m = 2 * 2 in (* n *)
let x = n + 1 in (* n, m *)
let y = m + 2 in (* m, x *)
    x + y        (* x, y *)
```

We look at the lifetimes of the variables and look for overlaps.

`m` and `n` better not be in the same register because we need both of theme to exist. `x` conflicts with both `m` and `n` (but a more refined version of this analysis would distinguish between the set that are defined, used, and killed at a specific site. In that case, `x` would not conflict with `m` and `n`).

**Conflict/interference graph:**

```
m ------ n
|  \   /
|    x
|  /   \
x ------ y
```

We need to solve the n color, where n is the number of registers we have open. We need at least 3 registers because we have a clique of size 3.

**Trimmed Conflict graph:**

```
m ------ n
|
|
|
x ------ y
```

Now we can have just 2. But let's look at the original conflict graph for now.

**Bad news: this algorithm is NP complete.**

Let's use this heuristic: color the highest degree first because it applies the most constraints. This will fail sometimes because it's a greedy algorithm. This is ok because we can just use the stack as spill over space when it fails.

Ok, we've figured out how we can just put intermediate values in registers and we've used all of them. Now, we need to do a tag check. Where will we put that new intermediate value?

One method is  to just push any register on to the stack and use that register and restore after. This could cause very inefficient compiled code.

Another method is to include all the tag check registers into the conflict graph. For all expressions in our program, we create the conflict graph. This is more consistent.

This method uses only the structure of our compiled code and not any property about the meaning of the code.

This is intrinsically a graph algorithm so we can't just use a tree to represent. How do we derive this graph from our program? We needed **interference graph** for the before, and we can have other graphs like **control flow graph**. Control flow graph is unideal to create from assembly because for every branch there's two branches, the explicit jump and implicit fallthrough branch. Our program will consist of basic blocks, starting from `our_code_starts_here`, where each basic block is a block of assembly starting from a label and ending in a branch.

There are no choices within a basic block. All assignments, updates will always happen. So, when analyzing a basic block, given an environment, we can confidently state at the exits of that basic block what the possible values are. And this will be definite. Definite is good beacuse we can do things like constant folding.

Unfortunately, we don't usually have complete environment. What if we ignore things that are not complete? It'll make things easier... but graphs can have back edges. We can have recursive functions. These case, we can lose precision about what we know about our variables. We can instead  try to compute to a fixed point (or close enough to a fixed point)

What if we have a for loop? `i` can be a range of values. But, that's too many values and our analysis will lose precision. So, we can just say `i` is a value or it's `ininity`. This is called widening. If it changes, we just give up.

If we can build this control flow graph, we can inline stuff. We can paste a graph where there used to be a node. This step will be after anf so things will be immediate when we need it.

Constant folding is very easy with a control flow graph. If we are confident about some values at the begnning of a block and at the end of the block, then just psate in those values.
