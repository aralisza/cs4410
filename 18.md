## Q&A

### Seq: desugar or not?

If you desugar into `let`s, it will create extra stack slots in order to store garbage. This can result in a higher minimum memory bound than expecting because if it's bound, it can't be garbage collected.

### Final project

Go to office hours some time this week to scope out project.

Possible projects:

* strings
* some kind of optimizations
    * get rid of "many" unnecessary moves
* objects
    * something like dictionaries
    * something like dynamic dispatch
    * constructors, state, inheritance, visibility, etc are all optional
    * implement objects as closures
* modules...?
    * circular dependencies?
    * multiple includes?
    * separate compilation?
    * imports shadowing?
    * ...many more
