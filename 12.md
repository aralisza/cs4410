# Type checking

```ocaml
type  typ =
    | TyCon of string (* like Int or bool *)
    | TyVar of string (* like 'a *)
    | TyArr of typ list * typ
    | TyApp of typ * typ list

(* in order to make the inference algorithm terminate, we need to force all the "for all"s are on the outside *)
type scheme = (string list * typ) (* for all a, b, ... tau *)
```

Higher ranked types have `for-all`s inside `for-all`s, but it makes type inference undecidable.

We're only ever going to rewrite in the more precise direction (older -> newer) in order to prevent cycling.

```txt
let f  g h x = h(g(h x))

f: alpha => beta -> gamma
(at this point, we forget about alpha. It's all beta->gamma now)

g: delta
h: epsilon
x: nu

f: beta -> gamma
g: delta
h: epsilon => (omega -> theta)
x: nu

f: beta -> (gamma => pi -> kappa)
g: delta
h: omega -> theta
x: nu

f: beta -> pi -> rho -> iota
g: delta
h: omega -> theta
x: nu

f: beta -> pi -> rho -> iota
g: delta
h: omega -> (theta => iota)
x: nu

f: beta -> pi -> rho -> iota
g: delta
h: omega -> iota
x: nu => omega

f: (beta => delta) -> pi -> rho -> iota
g: delta
h: omega -> iota
x: omega

f: (delta => chi -> psy) -> pi -> rho -> iota
g: (delta => chi -> psy)
h: omega -> iota
x: omega

f: chi -> psy -> (pi => omega -> iota) -> rho -> iota
g: chi -> psy
h: omega -> iota
x: omega

f: chi -> psy -> omega -> iota -> rho -> iota
g: chi -> psy
h: omega -> iota
x: omega

...
```

Substitute eagerly and completely. It's just equality constraints that we're substituting in.

We have to be careful that when we introduce new names,  we don't shadow old type names, just like in ANF (type capturing).

```ocaml
subst_tau name forTyp inTyp

subst_scheme name forType inScheme
(* if name is not present in scheme, then do rewrite. Otherwise, don't (capture renaming substitution) *)
(* schemes are kind of like lambdas for types. *)

type schemeenv = (string * sscheme) list

substs_env name forTyp inEnv

subst_subst name forTyp inSubst

type subst = (string * typ) list
```

To apply subst to subst, apply substitution to substitution and concatenate the old subst to keep directionality intact.

```ocaml
(* create a substitution that will convert typ to typ *)
unify : typ -> typ -> subst

var, tau -> [(var => tau)]
Const c, Const c -> []
Const c1, Const c2 -> error
Arr(args1, ret1), Arr(args2, ret 2) -> recur & fold
TyApp, TyApp -> ...
else -> error

unify for scheme
make up types for `string list` and substitute it into thee `typ`
```

Algorithm `W` (Hindley Milner) pushes errors from outside in, algorithm `M` pushes from bottom up.
